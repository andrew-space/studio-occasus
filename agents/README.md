# Round 5 Agent Playbook

## Mission

Ship a web MVP for the App Showcase that is functional, creative, AI-assisted, and deployable to GitHub Pages.

## Product Direction

### Concept in one sentence

Occasus Lab is a research-backed editorial web app that helps founders and small brands turn messy marketing ideas into clear messaging, sharper positioning, and cleaner campaign structure.

### Target audience

- founders and solo operators
- freelancers and consultants
- small service brands and creative studios
- marketing generalists who need clarity more than automation complexity

### Jury demo flow

The fastest demo flow is: paste weak copy into the Clarity Rewriter, show the improved version, then open the Brand Message Generator and show how a few guided answers become a positioning statement and value proposition.

### Visual direction

- Use the Studio Occasus logo as anchor branding.
- Use the LinkedIn banner as the main moodboard reference.
- Reuse the orange circle as a recurring action or focus cue.
- Show progression from organic forms to structured layouts to reflect chaos -> clarity.

## Operating Rules

- Keep the first version narrow. One strong workflow beats five weak features.
- Design for GitHub Pages constraints: static hosting, client-side logic, public assets only.
- Prefer stable browser-native features over fragile integrations.
- Every major change gets added to `agents/agent-log.md`.

## Build Priorities

1. Pick a concept with a clear user outcome.
2. Define one primary flow the judge can understand in under 30 seconds.
3. Build a visually strong, responsive interface.
4. Add enough polish to feel like a real MVP.
5. Deploy early, then iterate.

# Round 5 Agent Log

## Purpose

This file is the running history for Round 5. It should let a future session recover product context, technical decisions, and deployment state without replaying the entire conversation.

## 2026-04-10 - Kickoff

- Round 5 workspace already existed when work started.
- Brief captured for App Showcase / Ship Your MVP.
- Initial scaffolding created: `README.md`, `agents/README.md`, `agents/agent-log.md`, and `site/assets/`.
- Product direction then derived from the provided brief.
- Core concept selected: Occasus Lab as a research-backed clarity and messaging platform for founders and small brands.
- Primary jury flow selected: Clarity Rewriter first, Brand Message Generator second.
- Visual direction anchored to the Studio Occasus logo, LinkedIn banner, and process-shape references.

## 2026-04-10 - MVP build

- Copied deployable brand assets into `site/assets/`.
- Built a static landing page in `site/index.html`.
- Implemented three functional client-side tools:
- Clarity Rewriter
- Brand Message Generator
- UTM Builder
- Added first blog article in `site/cognitive-load-clarity.html`.
- Added editorial visual system in `site/assets/styles.css`.
- Added tool logic in `site/assets/app.js`.
- Added GitHub Pages workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
- Static validation completed with no file errors reported.

## Current State

- App concept is now locked at a high level.
- First functional MVP build exists locally.
- Deployment workflow is ready, but publishing has not happened yet.

## Update Rules

- Append new milestones with date and short rationale.
- Record user-visible problems before recording technical root cause.
- Note whether deployment was verified whenever a release happens.

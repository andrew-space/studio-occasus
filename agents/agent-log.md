# Studio Occasus Agent Log

## Purpose

This file is the running history for Studio Occasus (personal project). It should let a future session recover product context, technical decisions, and deployment state without replaying the entire conversation.

## 2026-04-10 - Kickoff

- Studio Occasus workspace already existed when work started.
- Brief captured for App Showcase / Ship Your MVP.
- Initial scaffolding created: `README.md`, `agents/README.md`, `agents/agent-log.md`, and `site/assets/`.
- Product direction then derived from the provided brief.
- Core concept selected: Occasus Lab as a research-backed clarity and messaging platform for founders and small brands.
- Primary jury flow selected: Clarity Rewriter first, Brand Message Generator second.
- Visual direction anchored to the Studio Occasus logo, LinkedIn banner, and process-shape references.

## 2026-04-10 - MVP build

- Copied deployable brand assets into `site/assets/`.
- Built a static landing page in `site/index.html`.
- Implemented three functional client-side tools:
- Clarity Rewriter
- Brand Message Generator
- UTM Builder
- Added first blog article in `site/cognitive-load-clarity.html`.
- Added editorial visual system in `site/assets/styles.css`.
- Added tool logic in `site/assets/app.js`.
- Added GitHub Pages workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
- Static validation completed with no file errors reported.

## 2026-04-10 - Repository and publish setup

- Initialized git in Studio Occasus project and created the first commit: `e4bad36`.
- Created GitHub repository `studio-occasus` (originally named `ai-challenge-round5-studio-occasus`; renamed 2026-04-13).
- Pushed `main` to GitHub.
- Enabled GitHub Pages in workflow mode.
- Live URL: `https://andrew-space.github.io/studio-occasus/`.

## Current State

- App concept is now locked at a high level.
- First functional MVP build exists locally.
- Publishing pipeline has been started on GitHub Actions.

## 2026-04-13 - Strategic Reunion (Agent 12 orchestrated)

**Problem identified:** Studio Occasus is a collection of AI-assisted tools, but lacks:
- Clear monetization strategy
- Reason for users to stay vs. using ChatGPT directly
- Coherent service proposition
- Sustainable business model

**Decision: Reposition as "Clarity Service + Tools"**

**Key outcomes:**
1. **Service narrative:** "Get your core message right before you spend a dollar on marketing"
2. **Freemium model:** Free tier (limited rewrites + basic tools) vs Pro ($12-24/mth: unlimited + team collab)
3. **Backend mandatory:** User accounts (Firebase Auth) + payment processing (Stripe)
4. **UX progression:** Diagnostic → Message Clarity Report → Save/Export (free) → Pro upgrade
5. **Timeline:** 2-3 weeks to soft launch freemium service model

**Team orchestration:**
- Agent 1: Update strategic positioning brief
- Agent 8: Unblock Firebase config (BLOCKER #1)
- Agents 2+10: Design UX progression + onboarding
- Agents 3+8: Auth + Stripe integration (staged)
- Agent 4: Rewrite copy for "service" not "tools"
- Agent 6: Review for coherence + risk
- Agent 5: QA + staged rollout plan

**Full reunion notes:** See `reunion-strategique-2026-04-13.md`

**Risk mitigation:** All backend changes require pre-risk backup (`scripts/project-backup.ps1`)

---

- Complete UX/UI rewrite following Refokus/HubSpot/NeilPatel patterns.
- Tabbed tool switcher (eliminated vertical scroll).
- Sticky nav with backdrop-blur.
- Full-height hero with before/after demo card.
- Dark inverted system section.
- Responsive design (980px, 640px breakpoints).
- Committed as `3262f39`, pushed to GitHub.

## 2026-04-10 — v3 Freemium expansion

- **Architecture**: Added Firebase Auth (Google Sign-In) + Firestore for user data, usage tracking, blog CMS.
- **Freemium model**: Free tier (5 clarity/day, 3 brand/day, unlimited UTM) vs Pro (€9/mo, €79/yr, unlimited everything + Tone Analyzer + Headline Scorer).
- **New tools**: Tone Analyzer (formal/casual/technical/persuasive breakdown) and Headline Scorer (length/power/clarity/emotion out of 100) — both Pro-gated.
- **Auth flow**: Google Sign-In popup → Firestore user doc → avatar dropdown with plan display → admin link for whitelisted emails.
- **Usage tracking**: localStorage primary with daily reset, Firestore sync when authenticated.
- **Blog expansion**: Added blog.html hub with NotebookLM pipeline explainer. Added second article (signal-noise-marketing.html). Updated cognitive-load-clarity.html nav.
- **Admin CMS**: admin.html + admin.js — protected panel with dashboard stats, blog article CRUD, user management with Pro toggle.
- **Pricing section**: Free vs Pro comparison cards with upgrade modal (monthly/yearly toggle).
- **New agents**: agent-6-review-expert.md (UX/UI critic), agent-7-blog-notebooklm.md (editorial pipeline), agent-8-backend-architect.md (Firebase infrastructure).
- **Review agent pass**: Identified and fixed 33 critical DOM ID mismatches between HTML and JS, fixed form submit handling, added missing metric/result elements.
- **CSS additions**: Usage bar, pro gates/badges, modals, toasts, avatar dropdown, pricing cards, tone analyzer bars, headline score bars, blog page, admin panel, fade-in/delay animations.

## 2026-04-10 — v5 merge and stabilization

- **User-visible issue reported**: Site perceived as broken after UI merge.
- **v5 merge delivered**: Restored v3 editorial tab UI while keeping v4 scope.
- **Tools scope now active**: 10 tools total (including Word Counter, Readability, Email Subject, SEO Preview, Social Post PRO).
- **Gamification added**: XP, levels, streak display, badges, and challenge dashboard.
- **Blog direction kept**: HubSpot-style cards preserved and integrated into the restored visual system.
- **Pricing and messaging updated**: Free/Pro matrix aligned with 10-tool offer.
- **Commit published**: `30b252d` pushed to `main`.

## 2026-04-10 — post-merge hotfix (UX + wiring)

- **Root causes fixed**: UI wiring mismatches and design token inconsistencies (no syntax crash, but behavior regressions).
- **Functional fixes**:
- Reconnected Clarity sample loader.
- Switched Word Counter listener to `input` for live updates on typing and paste.
- Fixed UTM logic to count usage only after validation and include `utm_term`.
- Added Firebase guard for upgrade flow to prevent silent failures when config is missing.
- Aligned Brand tone mapping with current form options (`calm`, `direct`, `warm`).
- **Design fixes**:
- Added missing heading font token usage consistency.
- Replaced hardcoded warning reds with design-system variable.
- Improved responsive behavior for metrics/nav wrapping.
- **Validation**: No editor errors in `index.html`, `assets/styles.css`, `assets/app.js` after patch.
- **Commit published**: `2f1a94e` pushed to `main`.

## 2026-04-10 — security hardening + Stripe backend scaffold

- **Round 3 practices applied**: secret hygiene, browser-realistic API assumptions, and release-blocking QA checks.
- **Client billing hardening**: Removed direct client-side Pro elevation from upgrade flow in `site/assets/app.js`.
- **Backend billing path added**: Front now requests checkout session from secured backend endpoint (`BACKEND_CONFIG.checkoutEndpoint`).
- **Firebase+Stripe backend scaffold created**:
- `functions/index.js` with authenticated `createCheckoutSession` endpoint.
- `functions/index.js` with signed Stripe `stripeWebhook` endpoint.
- Idempotency baseline via `stripe_events` collection.
- **Security controls added**:
- New agent file `agents/agent-9-security-guardian.md`.
- CI workflow `.github/workflows/security-guardian.yml` running secret scan + anti-pattern checks on push/PR.
- Local scanner script `scripts/security-scan.ps1`.
- Root `.gitignore` now blocks `.env` and service-account leaks.
- **Firebase config files added**: `firebase.json`, `firestore.rules`, `functions/.env.example`, `functions/README.md`.
- **Deployment status**: Backend scaffold committed locally and pending Firebase project env wiring before full payment activation.

## 2026-04-10 — final handoff before shutdown

- **User-visible state**: App is live on the new URL but currently reports Firebase not connected.
- **Root cause confirmed**: `site/assets/firebase-config.js` still has empty `FIREBASE_CONFIG` fields.
- **Repository migration complete**:
- New canonical repo: `https://github.com/andrew-space/occasus-lab`
- New canonical Pages URL: `https://andrew-space.github.io/occasus-lab/`
- **Firebase tooling status**:
- Firebase CLI installed (`firebase-tools 15.14.0`) via `firebase.cmd`.
- Local helper created: `scripts/firebase-setup.ps1`.
- `.firebaserc` baseline created with placeholder project id.
- **Backend/security status**:
- Secure checkout scaffold in `functions/index.js`.
- Firestore rules and security workflow in place.
- Local security scanner passing.
- **Exact resume sequence for next session**:
1. Run `firebase login`.
2. Run `firebase use --add` and set real project.
3. Fill `site/assets/firebase-config.js` with real Firebase web config.
4. Replace backend endpoint placeholder project id in `site/assets/firebase-config.js`.
5. Set Stripe runtime env vars (do not commit secrets).
6. Deploy: `firebase deploy --only functions,firestore:rules`.
7. Push frontend config update to `occasus-lab` and verify auth on live URL.
8. Confirm Security Guardian workflow green.

- **Latest repo state for continuity**:
- Recent setup commit pushed to `occasus-lab`: `6015b6d`.
- Agent/security rollout commits were pushed before handoff on same branch.

## 2026-04-10 — Firebase connection restored and live auth verified

- **User-visible outcome**: Firebase is now connected and Google Sign-In works again on the live Studio Occasus site.
- **Firebase project linked**: `studio-occasus`.
- **Auth work completed**:
- Firebase CLI login completed successfully.
- Real web config injected into `site/assets/firebase-config.js`.
- `.firebaserc` updated to default to `studio-occasus`.
- Firestore rules deployed successfully.
- Better auth diagnostics added in `site/assets/app.js` and `site/assets/admin.js` for unauthorized domain / disabled provider cases.
- **Production release**:
- Firebase connection commit pushed: `4b359e4`.
- Cache-busted verification confirmed the live Pages site serves the real Firebase config.

## 2026-04-10 — UX/UI refresh + EN/FR switch published

- **User-visible outcome**: The live site now has a more dynamic branded background, a guided tool workspace, and a working EN/FR language switch.
- **Visual direction update**:
- Added moving Occasus-inspired background atmosphere using the banner and app icon motifs.
- Reworked the tools area into a two-column workspace with focused active-tool header and prev/next navigation.
- Eliminated the need to horizontally scroll through tools.
- Added mobile tool selector for smaller screens.
- **Language system**:
- Added persistent EN/FR switch in the nav.
- Localized the main shell, tool navigation, CTA/auth blocks, and the most visible tool messages.
- Stored language preference in localStorage.
- **Production release**:
- UX/lang refresh commit pushed: `f0fa3cd`.
- Live Pages verification confirmed presence of `tool-workspace`, `lang-switch`, `site-atmosphere`, and new JS translation hooks.

## 2026-04-10 — canonical deploy state after latest session

- **Current live repo**: `https://github.com/andrew-space/studio-occasus`
- **Current live URL**: `https://andrew-space.github.io/studio-occasus/`
- Local repo deploy target: `origin` -> `studio-occasus`
- Future sessions should verify whether `occasus-lab` is still needed before treating it as canonical.

## Recommended next session focus

1. Extend EN/FR translation coverage to blog pages and admin panel.
2. Refine tool result cards and microcopy for a more premium, guided feel.
3. Revisit backend/Stripe only after the frontend shell and bilingual UX feel stable.
4. Repo strategy: deploying from `studio-occasus` as personal project (outside Challenge Arena).

## 2026-04-13 - New session kickoff (learning track)

- Session reopened for continued work on Studio Occasus.

## 2026-04-13 - Team Manager deployment mission activated

## 2026-04-14 - Autonomous improvement loop activated

- Team governance upgraded to support a human-like autonomous improvement cycle led by Agent 12.
- Added Mode F to collaboration protocol for continuous detect -> prioritize -> apply -> review loop.
- Added strict auto-apply guardrails:
	- allowed for low-risk UX/copy/localization/tool fixes,
	- blocked without explicit approval for auth, billing, security, Firestore rules, or deploy path changes.
- Added weekly reunion structure to review shipped outcomes, missed issues, and next sprint commitments.
- Added manager command template for autonomous operation with escalation to gated Mode E when risk is medium/high.

## 2026-04-14 - Weekly runbook added for autonomous operations

- Added `agents/autonomous-weekly-runbook.md` with a practical Monday-Friday operating rhythm.
- Includes daily micro-cycle, auto-apply checklist, validation checklist, weekly reunion template, and manager kickoff script.
- Linked runbook into Team Manager and collaboration protocol to keep Mode F executable, not theoretical.

## 2026-04-14 - Four-week autonomous simulation prepared

- Added `agents/autonomous-4week-simulation.md` to simulate a full 4-week autonomous cycle with weekly outcomes and reunion checkpoints.
- Added `agents/stripe-readiness-gate.md` as the single gate document for Stripe Go or No-Go validation.
- Current Stripe decision status recorded as Conditional Go pending final live end-to-end checks.

## 2026-04-14 - Mode F daily cycle executed (low-risk auto-apply)

- Executed one full daily micro-cycle in Mode F with triage and direct low-risk implementation.
- Applied frontend-only quality fixes:
	- localized Tone Analyzer verdict/advice and output labels,
	- localized Headline Scorer winner messaging and score labels,
	- fixed Word Counter gamification over-counting by using positive word deltas,
	- improved FR diagnostic microcopy for audience-fit gap.
- No auth, billing, security rules, or deploy pipeline changes were made in this cycle.
- Cycle report saved to `agents/mode-f-cycle-2026-04-14.md`.

## 2026-04-14 - Mode F run executed for 5 cycles

- Completed a 5-cycle low-risk Mode F execution sequence and shipped all selected fixes.
- Admin stability improved: prevented duplicate list click bindings and made Pro toggle state deterministic.
- UX correctness improved: empty Word Counter now shows 0 min instead of 1 min.
- Accessibility improved: keyboard focus visibility added for tool tabs.
- FR microcopy quality improved for diagnostic audience-fit label.
- Run report saved to `agents/mode-f-5cycles-2026-04-14.md`.

## 2026-04-14 - Full product audit and improvement roadmap

**Audit completed.** Comprehensive review of all 10 tools, freemium model, gamification, conversion strategy, and codebase health.

### Key findings
1. **No real AI** — All 10 tools run client-side heuristics (jargon dictionaries, regex, syllable counting). The Clarity Rewriter swaps ~30 terms. Users will see through "AI-powered" marketing immediately.
2. **Freemium limits trivially bypassed** — All enforcement is localStorage. Incognito window = unlimited free usage.
3. **Stripe not validated** — Backend code exists but never tested end-to-end in production. Env vars not confirmed set.
4. **Zero analytics** — No event tracking whatsoever. Can't measure funnels, conversion, churn.
5. **Gamification volatile** — XP/streaks/badges stored only in localStorage. Lost on cache clear or device change.
6. **Exports promised but not built** — PDF/Notion/Figma mentioned in pricing UI but not implemented.
7. **No onboarding flow** — Users land in raw workspace with 10 tools and no guidance.

### Improvement roadmap agreed (4 sprints)
- **Sprint 1 (PRIORITY):** Stripe end-to-end validation + server-side freemium limits (Firestore) + analytics (PostHog/GA4)
- **Sprint 2:** Integrate 1 real AI call (Cloud Function for Clarity Engine) + implement guided onboarding (Mission 01)
- **Sprint 3:** PDF export for Pro users + email nurture sequence post-signup
- **Sprint 4:** Gamification Firestore sync + Brand Vault feature + admin business dashboard

### Roadmap saved to
- `agents/DECISIONS-SERVICE-MODEL.md` → new "NEXT IMPROVEMENT ROADMAP" section with full sprint breakdown, owner assignments, and weakness list.

### Session closed
- All pending local changes committed and pushed: `468fece`.
- Roadmap update committed separately (see next session push).
- **Resume command for next session:** "Continue Sprint 1 — Stripe validation + analytics + server-side limits"
2. Agent 2 translates that into UI/interaction placement.
3. Agent 3 implements the highest-value onboarding changes in `site/`.

## 2026-04-13 - Team learning and management layer added

- User intent clarified: Agent 10 should remain focused on product learning, not team memory.
- Added `agents/agent-11-memory-orchestrator.md` to make relevant session progress reusable across agents and future sessions.
- Added `agents/agent-12-team-manager.md` to coordinate delegation, sequencing, and delivery discipline across the agent team.
- Updated the team model so Studio Occasus now has three distinct layers:
1. Product learning for end users via Agent 10.
2. Shared operational memory via Agent 11.
3. Team orchestration and role guidance via Agent 12.
- Recommended default chain for future sessions:
1. Agent 12 scopes the right sub-team.
2. Specialist agents execute.
3. Agent 6 reviews if quality risk is non-trivial.
4. Agent 11 records only the durable lessons and handoff state.

## 2026-04-13 - Collaboration protocol and Mission 01 launched

- Added `agents/team-collaboration-protocol.md` as the default operating system for the 12-agent team.
- Added `agents/mission-01-guided-onboarding.md` as the first mission formally led by Agent 12.
- Mission 01 targets the highest-value short-term gap in the live product: clearer first-use guidance across the three core tools.
- Default execution chain for Mission 01 is now set to:
1. Agent 12 for scope and sequencing.
2. Agent 10 for learning path.
3. Agent 2 for UX placement.
4. Agent 3 for implementation.
5. Agent 6 for review.
6. Agent 11 for durable handoff.

## 2026-04-13 - Mission 01 first deliverable completed

- Agent 10 produced `agents/mission-01-learning-brief.md`.
- The mission now has a concrete beginner path: clarity -> brand -> UTM.
- Guidance pattern agreed for implementation: start here, what to paste, what you get, next best step.
- Next active owner should be Agent 2 to translate this into a compact workspace component before frontend implementation begins.

## 2026-04-13 - Local backup and restore safety net added

- Added `scripts/project-backup.ps1` to create labeled local rollback snapshots before risky deploys or refactors.
- Added `scripts/project-restore.ps1` to restore the latest or a named snapshot.
- Added `BACKUP-RESTORE.md` as the operating guide for backup and recovery.
- Updated `.gitignore` so local backup archives stay out of the repository.
- Updated Security Guardian guidance so pre-release backup creation is now part of the runtime safety checklist.

## Update Rules

- Append new milestones with date and short rationale.
- Record user-visible problems before recording technical root cause.
- Note whether deployment was verified whenever a release happens.

## 2026-04-13 - Team Manager roast + full-team brainstorm activated

- User requested a hard critique of the current product and a high-energy, all-agent brainstorm.
- Agent 12 now contains a dedicated "War Room" section with:
1. Brutal roast findings on product differentiation gaps.
2. Explicit no-overlap brainstorm assignments for Agents 1 through 12.
3. A difference-first sprint rule: ship only what improves clarity outcome, trust, activation, or conversion.
- Session operating mode shifted to "Roast-to-Result" to avoid feature vanity and AI-fluff outputs.

## 2026-04-14 - Reunion multi-agents executee (post-deploy, sans Stripe)

- Reunion operationnelle conduite par Agent 12 avec arbitrages croises Agent 1 (strategie), Agent 2 (UX), Agent 3 (frontend), Agent 4 (narrative), Agent 5 (deploy), Agent 8 (data), Agent 10 (onboarding).
- Objectif valide: augmenter activation et intention d'upgrade sans ajouter Stripe dans ce cycle.

### Decisions appliquees immediatement

1. Ajouter une instrumentation funnel minimale cote produit.
2. Ajouter un bloc conversion "Free vs Pro" dans le flux des outils.
3. Ajouter un mini onboarding guide (quickstart 3 etapes) en haut du workspace.
4. Deployer apres backup local pre-risque.

### Implementation shipped

- `site/assets/app.js`
	- Ajout d'un logger d'evenements leger (`trackEvent`) avec retention locale.
	- Emission d'evenements cles: `page_view`, `quickstart_started`, `diagnostic_completed`, `diagnostic_to_clarity_clicked`, `clarity_run_completed`, `clarity_version_saved`, `positioning_generated`, `inline_upgrade_clicked`, `upgrade_modal_opened`, `checkout_session_requested`.
	- Envoi Firestore non-bloquant vers `analytics_events` si session auth active.
- `site/index.html`
	- Ajout d'un bloc "Quickstart in 2 minutes" avec CTA `Start quickstart`.
	- Ajout d'un bloc "Free vs Pro at a glance" avec CTA `Compare and upgrade`.
	- Ajout de styles locaux legers pour ces blocs (responsive).

### Risk handling

- Backup local cree avant modifications: `backups/20260414-144612-pre-agent-reunion-deploy.zip` + manifeste associe.
